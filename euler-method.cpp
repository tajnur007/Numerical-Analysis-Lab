Euler Method for solving differential equation
Given a differential equation dy/dx = f(x, y) with initial condition y(x0) = y0. Find its approximate solution using Euler method.

Euler Method :
In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method (also called forward
Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedurefor solving ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.
Consider a differential equation dy/dx = f(x, y) with initialcondition y(x0)=y0
then succesive approximation of this equation can be given by:

y(n+1) = y(n) + h * f(x(n), y(n))

where h = (x(n) â€“ x(0)) / n
h indicates step size. Choosing smaller
values of h leads to more accurate results
and more computation time.



Example :


    Consider below differential equation
            dy/dx = (x + y + xy)
    with initial condition y(0) = 1 
    and step size h = 0.025.
    Find y(0.1).
   
    Solution:
    f(x, y) = (x + y + xy)
    x0 = 0, y0 = 1, h = 0.025
    Now we can calculate y1 using Euler formula
    y1 = y0 + h * f(x0, y0)
    y1 = 1 + 0.025 *(0 + 1 + 0 * 1)
    y1 = 1.025
    y(0.025) = 1.025.
    Similarly we can calculate y(0.050), y(0.075), ....y(0.1).
    y(0.1) = 1.11167
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.

Output :
Approximate solution at x = 0.1  is  1.11167
